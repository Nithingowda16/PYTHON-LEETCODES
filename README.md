# Python LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my Python LeetCode solutions repository! Here, you'll find my implementations of various LeetCode problems using Python. This repository is aimed at helping others learn and understand algorithms and data structures by providing clear, concise solutions to common coding challenges.

## Why LeetCode?

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is a popular platform for practicing coding interview questions. It offers a vast array of problems categorized by difficulty level and topic. By solving LeetCode problems, you can enhance your problem-solving skills, familiarize yourself with common algorithms and data structures, and prepare for technical interviews.

## Repository Structure

- Each problem solution is organized into its own directory under the `solutions` directory.
- Solutions are named according to the LeetCode problem number and title.
- Each solution includes a Python file containing the implementation and a README.md file explaining the problem and approach.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute a solution, please follow these guidelines:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature (`git checkout -b feature/new-solution`).
3. Add your solution in the appropriate directory within the `solutions` folder.
4. Include a README.md file in your solution directory explaining the problem and your approach.
5. Test your solution with example inputs and outputs.
6. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new solution for problem XYZ'`).
7. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/new-solution`).
8. Create a new Pull Request.
